# Illumio Assessment

## Steps to Setup and Run
1. Download the contents of the repository into a folder
2. Set up Python on the local device
3. Run the file - Solution.ipynb

## To test
1. Change the input files:
   a. lookup_table.csv - Enter look up table in .csv format
   b. vpc_flow_log.txt - Provide log files in .txt format

### Time Complexity 
Time Complexity for processing the flow logs is O(N) where N is the number of lines in the logs

### Space Complexity: 
Space Complexity is O(K) + O(L) where K is the number of lines in the lookup table, and L is the number of unique tags.
